# Naut

_Project status:_ under development

## Summary

Naut is a single-player, click based spaceship game. It is a very rudimentary version of attempting to develop Kestral A in p5.js. It has the following features as of now:

- main menu
- help
- game arena
- exit

## How to play the game

When you start the game, the hull on your spaceship starts decreasing based on the attacks from the enemy spaceship. You are to break down the enemy(target) spaceship's compartments by aiming on them. A click on the compartment could mean a hit or a miss based on the dodge value of the enemy ship.

Keep clicking all the compartments until the values turn 0 to destroy a compartment completely. Destrol all compartments to destroy the enemy ship.

To win, you have to destroy the enemy ship before it destroys your home ship.
